# Covid-19-EDA-using-R
The data used was: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series (just the deaths global and the confirmed global csv's).
This project was done under the Programming for Data Science assignment, while doing my Master's on the National Technical University of Athens.
It contains various plots and an animation, divided in 8 scripts.

Before running any script, run the ```'preprocess.r'``` script first so that you read the latest data, and manage the data in 10 tasks specified by the assignment.
